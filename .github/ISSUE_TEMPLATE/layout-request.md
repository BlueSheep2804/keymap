**What is the language/locale code for the layout you want to add**
you can check https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Languages for these

**Is there an existing variation of the layout you want to add**
eg: en_us is a variation for en_gb, this is to help us have a better starting point for the layout

**Please provide an image of the layout, preferably the full standard layout for the language**
this can be an image from Google, or an image of your own keyboard

**Anything else you want us to keep in mind while working on the layout**
this can be left blank
