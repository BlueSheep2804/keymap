# Keymap

### What

A visual keymapping mod, specially helpful if you have tons of mods that add keybinds

### Why

Why not, also, vanilla keybind screen + controlling isn't cutting it, and for some reason, searching with controlling is
slow on my machine

### Features

- Visualize all assigned keys
- Visualize keys with multiple assignments
- Filter by searching and/or by category
- You can also filter the keybind with its bound key by using square brackets eg; `[left button]`
- Set keybinds by either pressing a keyboard key or by clicking on the any virtual keys (_except mouse buttons, which can only be set with the virtual keys_)
- Sleek UI (_lol_)
- OCD Triggering misalignment of some panels ( _:D_ )

### Images?

- Base look

  - ðŸŸ© `Set`
  - ðŸŸ¥ `Conflict`
  - ðŸŸ¨ `Bound to selected item`

### Help I can't xx

- **Can't rebind mouse keys?**
  - Currently, rebinding mouse key requires the user to click on the `ML`, `MM`, and `MR` buttons to assign the `Left button`, `Middle Button`, and `Right Button` respectively.

### BUG!

- [ ] Show the actions bound to the key on hover
- [ ] Show the key bound to the action on hover
