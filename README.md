### New

- Malilib support added! but is currently `UNSTABLE` as it has not gone through much testing,
  will be pushing updates in the following days along with the 1.17 build

### What

- A visual keymapping mod, specially helpful if you have tons of mods that add keybinds

### Why

- Why not, also, vanilla keybind screen + controlling isn't cutting it, and for some reason, searching with controlling is
  slow on my machine
- ~~Why use a keybind instead of replacing the keybinds screen? idk, I find it easier to use that way, do hit me up if you prefer to have it replace the keybinds screen as a configurable feature~~ (check "How" section)

### How

- The default keybind is ```" ` "```, aka, the grave accent key, the key below the escape key, or the key along with the tilde `" ~ "`
- If you'd like to have the old Keybinding screen on the options>controls>keybinds menu, then disable `Override Keybind Screen` (access it via ModMenu)

### Required Mods

- [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
- [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
- [ModMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) (_to access config_)

### Features

- Visualize all assigned keys
- Visualize keys with multiple assignments
- Filter by searching and/or by category
- You can also filter the keybind with its bound key by using square brackets eg; `[left button]`
- Set keybinds by either pressing a keyboard key or by clicking on the any virtual keys (_except mouse buttons, which can only be set with the virtual keys_)
- Sleek UI (_lol_)
- ~~OCD Triggering misalignment of some panels ( _:D_ )~~ (_removed :<_)
- Completely replaces the default keybinds screen (enabled by default, disable via modmenu config)
- Shows all keybinds bound to a key via tooltip
- Malilib supported along with it's chained hotkeys

### Latest Changes

- Malilib support (_support custom chained keybinds like normal malilib hotkey config, currently keypresses except modifiers are limited to 2 keys_)
- UI rewrite
- New custom widgets from scratch, no more mojank code (_except legacy deprecated code kept for reference, will remove soon_)

---

### Help I can't xx

- **Can't rebind mouse keys?**
  - Currently, rebinding mouse key requires the user to click on the `ML`, `MM`, and `MR` buttons to assign the `Left button`, `Middle Button`, and `Right Button` respectively.
